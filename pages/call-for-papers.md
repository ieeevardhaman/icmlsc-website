A sustainable society is driven by the principle of realizing peace and prosperity for all people and the planet with an inclusiveness that “leaves no one behind.”
This track takes paper submissions on research and development of AI/ML techniques in the context of sustainable societies. Topics may include, but are not limited to:
Techniques for large-scale data analysis, participatory sensing and crowd-sourced data collection. 
Decision-support models in healthcare, education, governance and social policy.
Analysis of massive, complex data sources.
Methods for working with unstructured data .
Handling of missing data, including data cleaning, data wrangling, data integration, and domain adaptation methods.
Data privacy, security, and anonymity while building machine learning models.
FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics) in AI and ML, especially as it applies to applications of these technologies in social impact domains.
Methods may be applied to relevant areas that aim towards social impact and sustainable societies, including but not limited to: agriculture, poverty mapping, disease surveillance, health screening, learning outcomes, resource allocation, etc. 
We also encourage contributions on machine learning-led solutions for sustainable societies.
